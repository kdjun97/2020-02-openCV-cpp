- Read an image "moon.png" as gray scale image
    - Perform histogram equalization on the input image
        - Display each image with the window name as “before”, “after”
- Display histogram of the input and the result image
    - Set the number of bins as 16
    - Set the matrix size for displaying histogram as width:512, height:512
    - Display each image with the window name as “h1”, “h2”
