# Computer Vision with c++

## Morphological_Operation

- Develop a program which counts the number of people in a frame
    - Modify pixel based background subtraction implemented in assignment 10
    - Or you may use other background methods provided in openCV (e.g., MoG2)
    - Read ‘background.mp4’ as gray scale
    - ~~Set background image as the average of the first 10 frames~~
    - You can use any threshold for background subtraction
    - You can use any type of **morphological operation**
    - You can use any constrains on the size of bounding rectangle
    - To measure the performance of the system, we will use the first 10 seconds of the input video
